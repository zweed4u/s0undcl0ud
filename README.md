Exploits soundcloud's api, specifically their twitter integration.
Series of webscrapes and parsing allows for raw data to be displayed.  


Updates will include:  
 - Best search for artist/song instead of needing track url  
 - Prompt for format (mp3 or m3u8)  
 - Timeout display on json page parse to avoid access denied/403  
 - Variables for paths, etc. for fixed stuff  
 - Will save to current folder/songs new directory to allow x-filesystems
